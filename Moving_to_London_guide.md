# Moving to London guide

Moving to a new city and country will always be stressful.\
There are some tips for London.\
**Disclaimer: not financial advice!**

## Temporary accommodation
After arrival you will need temporary accommodation for a few weeks or maybe longer until you set up a UK bank and rent an apartment. Many people use Airbnb.

## Sim
Get a UK phone number on your first day.\
Pay as You Go (PaYG) SIM charges your connected card every month (pretty much like Netflix), they are usually not expensive and do not require credit check. PaYG SIM can be ordered online (to your Airbnb address) or purchased in any grocery store. It’s very easy to transfer a phone number to another operator later. \
[Smarty](https://smarty.co.uk/) had reasonable rates and free roaming in the EU ([referral link](https://i.smarty.co.uk/RtDRJO)). 

## Bank
Apply for a UK bank account right after you get a SIM card. 
You need a UK bank account to proceed with renting an apartment for a long term. 

There are 3 types of Current account providers you should know about: 
- High street banks: HSBC, Barklays, Lloyds, etc. They have physical branches.
  - `+` Perks like overseas health insurance for the whole family (on premium account)
  - `+` Always accepting SWIFT transfers (even from Russia) 
  - `-` Foreign transaction fees
  - `-` Bad customer service
  - `-` They might block large transaction (like paying rent) and ask you to call them and wait 1 hour on the line to get it unblocked.
- Digital banks: Starling, Monzo. **Good banks for day-to-day use.**
- Revolut: not a bank (no banking license in the UK, so no FSCS protection)
  - `+` Good exchange rates
  - `+` Paying from currency account overseas with same card
  - `+` Disposable cards for websites you don't trust
  - `+` Domestic transfer account in the US
  - `+` It is also suitable for paying rent, bills and daily spending
  - `-` They used to block accounts for few months in the past, so I wouldn't keep too much money with them

Many banks will require [proof of address](https://statrys.com/blog/what-is-a-proof-of-address) for your current residence.\
At least Monzo and Revolut do not require proof of address, so I recommend applying for both.

If a Financial Institution is not treating you in a fair way use [Financial Ombudsman Service](https://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/)
- Tell your Financial Institution that you would like to file `a formal complaint`
- Explain what is the whole situation in that complain, tell they how they can make things right and ask for `final written response`. It will take few weeks
- This usually helps to get someone from qualified support to actually look at your case and make things right
- If you are not satisfied with resolution, file a complaint on [Financial Ombudsman Service website](https://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/), it will take even more weeks

## Transport
No need to get an Oyster card, paying by bank card/phone will cost the same, just make sure you use the same card as there is a daily cap on Transport for London (TfL).\
If your travel does not include Zone 1, it will be almost 2 times cheaper!

For route planning use the Citymapper app, it usually works better than Google Maps.\
For travel to nearby cities get a Railcard it will give you a massive 30%+ discount.\
There are Railcards for one person, but they usually have age restrictions, Two Together card does not have age restriction but requires both people to travel together.\

Cycling might be a good option for short distances, try Borisbikes (red Santander bikes sharing).
If you own a bike, don’t leave it without a proper lock or it **will get stolen for sure**.

## Housing
Before looking for an apartment, travel to the area and have a walk.\
Get a feel if you want to live there, investigate shops and transport connections.

Search properties at [RightMove](rightmove.co.uk), call an agent and set up a viewing as early as agent can do. If you come first you will have higher chance to get that property.\
Look for mold and check sound from the road/neighbors. **Never rent an apartment with single glazed windows.**

Ask for a breaking clause, best to have 6 months in case there will be some problems.\
Ask landlord to fix stuff when you making offer.\
There could be competition for the best apartments so you might need to overbid.

Worst season to search for an apartment is September.

Read about renting more, there are government supplied guides.\
Landlord/agent will perform a reference check, make sure to ping them every other day if they need more information from you.

There is [Housing Ombudsman](https://www.housing-ombudsman.org.uk/), it can help to resolve problems with dishonest landlords.

## Utilities
You will need to make your utilities contracts for: 
- Water (it’s Thames Water in London)
- Energy (gas and electricity) it usually will be the same company for both
- Broadband (pick fastest speed you can get)
- Notify the Council about all people moving in, they will send you Council tax invoice

## Medical
Register with a GP nearby, preferably nearby. Usually you can register online. Seek help with non urgent matters through GP. You can ask if your matter is urgent by calling 111

For life threatening matters either call emergency 999 or get to nearest Accident & Emergency (A&E).
If your life is not in danger but you still need urgent help go to A&E.

## Savings
If you don’t use all your money, set up [Instant Access Savings Account](https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/savings/savings-accounts-best-interest/) and get some interest on it\
[Read more about ISA](https://www.gov.uk/individual-savings-accounts) it’s Tax free savings account.

## Shops
Amazon works well for a lot of stuff\
Furniture: IKEA, John Levis, Dunelm\
Electronics: Currys, Argos,

## Driving
[Check](https://www.gov.uk/driving-nongb-licence) if you can drive with non-UK driving license.\
After 6 months living in the UK you can get [Provisional Driving License](https://www.gov.uk/apply-first-provisional-driving-licence) which will let you learn to drive and it's also an official ID.
